Once I start going for depth more than 3, I will exhaust my API limit\r\nbefore finishing, still that data won't be able to help much.\r\n- It makes sense if Github does it, doesn't make sense if I try to replicate their \r\ndatabase and find contact relationships.\r\n- This was meant as an exercise to learn Go language, and certainly has helped me a lot\r\n- Time to build something new :)\r\n\r\nHow to use\r\n----------------\r\n- Make sure you have Go environment set\r\n- Checkout code; cd linkedhub\r\n- export GOPATH=`pwd`\r\n- go build github.com/omie/linkedhub\r\n- ./linkedhub\r\n\r\n\r\nDemo\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[Demo output](http://omkarnath.me/linkedhub/)\r\n\r\nScreenshot\r\n\r\n![linkedhub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Omie/linkedhub/screenshot/linkedhub.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n--------\r\nMIT License","google":"UA-50478828-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
