linkedhub
=========

Contact discovery like LinkedIn, something to learn Go language.

Crawl through user's repositories to find other collaborators and repeat.

Currently work-in-progress.

TODO:
- Improve code. This one just works for a while until free api limit is reached
- Get a developer account if possible
- Write out html document that uses something like d3 to display collaborator network
